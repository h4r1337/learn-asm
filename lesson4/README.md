## Lesson 4
> Subroutines

- Reusable pieces of code that can be called by the program to perfrom various repeatable tasks like functions.
- Instead of `jmp` we use instructions `call` and `ret` to get the subroutine and return back to our program respectively.
- It make use of the stack to jump to and back from the subroutine.
- `push` and `pop` instructions are used to insert and delete values in the stack.
